# Natter

Every parent is worried when his son is attending a school trip as well as every teacher is worried to lose one of the students.

This application provides the teacher with the possibility to create a group, directly contact each member or the entire crew with text and vocal messages and permanently tracks all movements of each group-mate.

Parents can easily check the position of their sons and contact them while at work.

The strong point of this solution is the low battery consumption.

For this project an Android application, J2EE Web Service and a SQL Data Base were modelled, developed and deployed.
